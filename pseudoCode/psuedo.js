// <!-- two players
//      1. both players throw down card until there are no more cards in one of the player's hand
//         // create an two objects with cards
//         //  these are the player's hand
//             // 1st Object
//                 // cards:
//                         green,
//                         red,
//                         yellow,

//             // 2nd Object
//                 // cards
//                     green,
//                     red,
//                     yellow,

//             // a loop
//                 loop through each object 

//             // To Begin
//                 // have a function to loop through each player's hand[ 1st object] until the output of both match 
//                     // use an if statement to see if the results match
//                     // if they do then output 'they match'
//                         //...

//      2. the cards either player throws down must match the card previously thrown down

//      3. if the player does not have a matching card then a new card is added to their hand
//         // this is an array, a new index is added to this players array
//             // if there are no matching cards in the master array

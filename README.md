<!-- two players
     1. both players throw down card until there are no more cards in one of the player's hand
        // create an two objects with cards
        //  these are the player's hand
            // 1st Object
                // cards:
                        green,
                        red,
                        yellow,



            // 2nd Object
                // cards
                    green,
                    red,
                    yellow,

            // a loop
                loop through each object 

            // To Begin
                // have a function to loop through each player's hand[ 1st object] until the output of both match 
                    // use an if statement to see if the results match
                    // if they do then output 'they match'
                        //...

     2. the cards either player throws down must match the card previously thrown down

     3. if the player does not have a matching card then a new card is added to their hand
        // this is an array, a new index is added to this players array
            // if there are no matching cards in the master array
